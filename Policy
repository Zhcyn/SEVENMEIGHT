Daily tracker for an individual's macro-splits (nutrition).
MyFitnessPal has a'Quick Add' option only allowing you to add calories and not the macros (unless you are a premium member). When I can't find a certain food in the database that they provide, such as food from dining halls, I would like to add the macros and calories of what I am eating.
The current application is still under development, and the current stage is mainly to test the continuity of the main interface UI and the integrity of the logical operation.
If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me
